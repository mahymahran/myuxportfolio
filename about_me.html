                Hi there! I'm Mahy - I'm 27 years old from Cairo, Egypt.<br><br>
                My bachelor's degree was in construction management which I received from the American university in Cairo in January of 2019.<br><br>
                For my first role I joined Marsh insurance brokerage as part of their graduate program where I relocated to Dubai. My role was supporting the energy and power engineers with project management and data analysis tasks.<br><br>
                After moving back to Egypt in November 2020, and for the past couple of years I've been working in primarily project management and data analysis roles.<br><br>
                I am actively pursuing full-time and part-time employment opportunities in the field of UX and Product design, especially in UX research and Interaction design which I believe my skills are most suitable for.<br><br>
                I am a team player and have great communication skills, so I believe these soft skills would help me adapt to most environments and established teams quickly.<br><br>
                I am a native Arabic speaker and a fluent English speaker. I also know some German (completed A1 with Goethe Institute Cairo).<br><br>
                I also have basic web development skills and I intend to study IBM's Front-end developer professional certificate on Coursera after completing the Google UX design certificate and finding gainful employment.<br><br>
